# DRIVE-Digital-Retinal-Images-for-Vessel-Extraction
We have done segmentation of blood vessels from their respective retinal images. As this is a segmentation model, we have used U-net architecture for the segmentation purpose. We have modified the typical convolution 2D layer to add new Dense Layer and finally got better result.
